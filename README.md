# Monotony

>   Platformers are supposed to have varied level styles, dynamic movement, and creative approaches to the same, core idea. Right?

## Description

Monotony is a 2D platformer aiming to provide a repetitive, hardcore platformer with a high-risk playstyle. Unlike most traditional platformers, with creative, diverse levels, Monotony follows a linear, predictable pattern designed to frustrate the player.

Made with Processing 4.4, an open-source programming language forked from Java. Processing's main purpose is to provide simple visual integration and graphics libraries designed for visual games and GUI.

## Features

- Simplistic movement controls
- An easy to learn, hard to master playstyle
- Repetitive level design
- Minimalist GUI
- Custom cursors
- Easy navigation
- Built-in themes

## Installation

### Processing

1.  Navigate to the Releases Page
    -   Navigate to the [Releases](https://github.com/MouseMouse625/Monotony/releases) section of this repository.

2.  Select the Latest Release
    -   Navigate to the latest release (e.g. v1.0.0).

3.  Download the Correct File for Your OS
    -   In the `Assets` section of the release, download the corresponding file for your operating system by clicking it:
        -   Windows: `binaryWindows64.zip`
        -   Linux: `binaryLinux64.zip`

4.  Extract the ZIP File
    -   Locate the downloaded ZIP file, probably in the downloads folder, and extract its contents. You can usually do this by right-clicking the file and selecting `Extract All` or using a tool like 7-Zip.

5.  Run the Game
    -   Locate and open the newly extracted folder.
    -   Open the nested folder of the same name.
    -   Run the game's executable file:
        -   Windows: Double-click `processingPlatformerSketch.exe`
        -   Linux: Run the `processingPlatformerSketch.x86_64` file. You may first need to make it executable using a command like `chmod +x processingPlatformerSketch.x86_64`.

    >   Note for Windows Users: Windows might show a "Windows protected your PC" warning. If you see this, click "More info" and then "Run anyway" to launch the game.

### VSCode

1. Install Visual Studio Code
    -   Download and install VSCode from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. Install Processing
    -   Download and install Processing 4.3.4 from the [official repository](https://github.com/processing/processing4/releases).

        >   This is due to Processing 4.4+ not having the processing-java.exe file, and the extension hasn't been updated yet.
    -   Important: After installation, run the Processing IDE (PDE) at least once to complete its initial setup.

3. Install the Processing Extension in VSCode
    -   Open VSCode.
    -   Go to the Extensions view.
        -   Press `Ctrl+Shift+X` for Windows.
        -   Press `Cmd+Shift+X` for MacOS.
    -    Search for and install the `Processing Language` extension by Avin Zarlez

4. Add the Sound Library in Processing
    -   Open the Processing IDE
    -   Go to `Sketch` > `Import Library` > `Add Library`
    -   In the Library Manager, search for `Sound` and click `Install`

5. Clone the Repository
    -   Clone this repository to your local machine, including all hidden files
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MouseMouse625/Monotony
   ```

6. Open the Project in VSCode
    -   Open the cloned project folder in VSCode using `File` > `Open Folder` and selecting the correct folder.

7. Configure the Build Tasks
    -   In the root of your project, create a `.vscode` folder if it doesn't exist.
    -   Inside the `.vscode` folder, create a file named `tasks.json`.
    -   Copy and paste the following JSON configuration into `tasks.json`:
    ```json
    {
        "version": "2.0.0",
        "tasks": [
            {
                "label": "Run Blur Creation",
                "type": "shell",
                "command": "C:\\Program Files\\Processing\\processing-4.3\\processing-java.exe",
                "args": [
                    "--sketch=${workspaceFolder}/source/blurs",
                    "--run",
                ],
                "problemMatcher": []
            },
            {
                "label": "Run Symlink Setup",
                "type": "shell",
                "command": "C:\\Program Files\\Processing\\processing-4.3\\processing-java.exe",
                "args": [
                    "--sketch=${workspaceFolder}/source/symlinks",
                    "--run",
                ],
                "problemMatcher": []
            },
            {
                "label": "Run Main Sketch",
                "type": "shell",
                "command": "C:\\Program Files\\Processing\\processing-4.3\\processing-java.exe",
                "args": [
                    "--sketch=${workspaceFolder}/source/main",
                    "--run",
                ],
                "problemMatcher": []
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    >   Modify the `"command"` paths in the `tasks.json` file to match the actual installation directories of `java.exe` on your computer, if you have opted for a custom installation.

8. Running the Game
    -   With the `tasks.json` file configured, you need to run the setup tasks.
        -   Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows
        -   Press `Cmd+Shift+P` on MacOS
    -   After opening the `Command Palette`, type `Run Task`, then press `Enter`.
    -   Run the following configured tasks in this order:
        -   `Run Symlink Setup`

            >   Wait for the window to close

            >   Note: the symlinks might fail, and if this happens, make sure to run VSCode as administrator to ensure the authority of creating them

        -   `Run Blur Creation`

            >   Wait for the window to close

        -   `Run Main Sketch`

            >   This is the command that runs the game
            
    -   From now on, only the last command is required to run the game

### Comparision

VSCode Version
-   Hard to setup
-   Better anti-alising as it detects app scaling
-   More optimised (less lag)
-   Uses a slightly outdated version of Processing

Processing Version
-   Easy to setup
-   Worse anti-aliasing due to not detecting the app scaling
-   Less optimised due to the native IDE not being the best (more lag)
-   Uses the most recent version of Processing

## Credits

The mocking text seen at the start of every level was inspired by [The World's Hardest Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World%27s_Hardest_Game),and the minimalism in both the sound effects and aesthetics was inspired by [OCO](https://oco-game.com/). Small parts such as the symlinks and blurs were coded and enhanced by AI, such as [DeepSeek](https://chat.deepseek.com/).
