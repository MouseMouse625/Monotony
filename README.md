# Monotony

> Platformers are supposed to have varied level styles, dynamic movement, and creative approaches to the same, core idea. Right?

## Description

Monotony is a 2D platformer aiming to provide a repetitive, hardcore platformer with a high-risk playstyle. Unlike most traditional platformers, with creative, diverse levels, Monotony follows a linear, predictable pattern designed to frustrate the player.

Made with Processing 4.4, an open-source programming language forked from Java. Processing's main purpose is to provide simple visual integration and graphics libraries designed for visual games and GUI.
