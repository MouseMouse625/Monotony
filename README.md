# Monotony

> Platformers are supposed to have varied level styles, dynamic movement, and creative approaches to the same, core idea. Right?

## Description

Monotony is a 2D platformer aiming to provide a repetitive, hardcore platformer with a high-risk playstyle. Unlike most traditional platformers, with creative, diverse levels, Monotony follows a linear, predictable pattern designed to frustrate the player.

Made with Processing 4.4, an open-source programming language forked from Java. Processing's main purpose is to provide simple visual integration and graphics libraries designed for visual games and GUI.

## Features

- Simplistic movement controls
- An easy to learn, hard to master playstyle
- Repetitive level design
- Minimalist GUI
- Custom cursors
- Easy navigation
- Built-in themes

## Credits

The mocking text seen at the start of every level was inspired by [The World's Hardest Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World%27s_Hardest_Game),and the minimalism in both the sound effects and aesthetics was inspired by [OCO](https://oco-game.com/).
