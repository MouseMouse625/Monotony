# Monotony
## Description
> Platformers are supposed to have varied level styles, dynamic movement, and creative approaches to the same, core idea. Right?

Monotony is a 2D platformer aiming to provide a repetitive, hardcore platformer with a high-risk playstyle. Unlike most traditional platformers, with creative, diverse levels, Monotony follows a linear, predictable pattern designed to frustrate the player.
